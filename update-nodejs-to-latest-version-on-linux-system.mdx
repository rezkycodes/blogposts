## Update Node.js with NVM (Node Version Manager)

1. Start by updating the package repository with the command:

```
sudo apt update
```
2. Install NVM using the curl command:
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
```
Alternatively, you use wget and run the command:
```
wget -q0- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
```
3. Close and reopen the terminal for system to recognize the changes or run the command:

```
source ~/.bashrc
```
4. Then, verify if you have successfully installed NVM:

```
nvm --version
```
5. Before upgrading Node.js, check which version you have running on the system:
```
nvm ls
```
6. Now you can check for newly available releases with:
```
nvm ls-remote
```

nvm install [version.number] or nvm install v20.10.0
```
